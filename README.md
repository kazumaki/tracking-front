## App Development

### Done

On the first day, I focused on developing the API calls to get data from [Tracking API](https://github.com/kazumaki/tracking-api) and store it inside the Redux store. On the second day I've focused on set-up a authentication system for my application. On the third day I've developed the basic layout of the application with all basic functionalities. On the fourth and fifth day I've worked on the styling of the application.

After login the application fetches measurements only once from the server and every action after this is done only on the client-side to avoid getting the list of measurements every time from the server, it just checks if the server returns a good response and then modify the redux store.

### Ideas for improvement

* Add edit measurement option
* Create a desktop version
* Display charts to better visualization of data
